khanacademy-extractor
=====================

[Khan Academy][1] is a great website that provide free video tutorial about Math, Science, Economics, Finance, Humanities, etc.

Since many people still have a problem with their internet connection speed ( including me ), then I decided to create this simple script.

This script will help you extract all videos URL and then download the video with [youtube-dl][2].

What to improve:
-[] GUI ( so we can choose what to download )
-[] Pause and Stop download ( for now it'll download all videos and you can't stop it )

Note:
* I'm using youtube-dl version 2013.10.30.
* Please always update the youtube-dl.
